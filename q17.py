PROBLEM::
There are numBottles water bottles that are initially full of water. You can exchange numExchange empty water bottles from the market with one full water bottle.

The operation of drinking a full water bottle turns it into an empty bottle.

Given the two integers numBottles and numExchange, return the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.

 

Example 1:


Input: numBottles = 9, numExchange = 3
Output: 13
Explanation: You can exchange 3 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle.
Number of water bottles you can drink: 9 + 3 + 1 = 13.
Example 2:


Input: numBottles = 15, numExchange = 4
Output: 19
Explanation: You can exchange 4 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle. 
Number of water bottles you can drink: 15 + 3 + 1 = 19.
 

Constraints:

1 <= numBottles <= 100
2 <= numExchange <= 100


SOLUTION::
class Solution:
    def numWaterBottles(self, numBottles: int, numExchange: int) -> int:
        total = numBottles
        empty = numBottles
        
        while empty >= numExchange:
            new_bottles = empty // numExchange
            total += new_bottles
            empty = empty % numExchange + new_bottles
        
        return total
PROBLEM::
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

 

Example 1:


Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

n == height.length
2 <= n <= 105
0 <= height[i] <= 104


SOLUTION::

class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
        max_area = 0
        while left < right:
            h = min(height[left], height[right])
            max_area = max(max_area, h * (right - left))
            if height[left] < height[right]:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
        
        return max_area
